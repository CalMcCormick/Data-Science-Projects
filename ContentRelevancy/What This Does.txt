CONTENT RELEVANCY PROJECT

This script has been designed to determine the similarity (and therefore relevancy) between two links
This is in an attempt to see how valuable the external links are that my client is receiving
The script takes in 2 URL's and returns a percentage similarity, a relevancy score and a relevancy multiplier*
 *the relvancy multiplier is being used because we just want to promote our existing metrics for the more relevant links

Process:

Scrape the site, use NLP preprocessing to standardise text, create a BoW dictionary
Repeat this for the other site.

Then the two BoW dictionaries get compared, using multipliers for the most used keywords.

The main script allows for a CSV file to be used as an input, and a new CSV file to be created for the output.
