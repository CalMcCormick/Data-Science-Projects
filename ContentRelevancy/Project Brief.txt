CONTENT SIMILARITY PROJECT

I currently work as an SEO Executive, with my main client being Compare the Market.
I manage the link building side of SEO for them, analysing the links their agencies secure for them.

THE PROBLEM
Google have openly said that the RELEVANCY of links is far more important than the quality of links.
However, they have given us no way of clearly defining how relevant a link is.

THE SOLUTION
This is basically split into two parts:
    1 - How relevant is the whole domain linking to your domain?
    2 - How relevant is the piece of content to the URL on your site it is linking to.

This project will initially be around answering the second issue. The answer? Similarity.
What's the most relevant page that can link to a car insurance page? A page on car insurance!

THEORY

Find out what one page is talking about
Find out what the other page is talking about

HOW WE DO This

Step 1: Scrape the target URL, gather, tokenize (remove stop words) and count each keyword. Get initial count of KW's.
Step 2: Scrape the from URL, repeat the process.
Step 3: Iterate over the target URL keywords, everytime it occurs in the from URL keywords, remove it.
Step 4: Once this is done, determine percentage of keywords left.
Step 5: Make it so it can accept a csv file and do this automatically.

AFTER

Figure out how to turn this percentage into a multiplier to apply to current link quality scores.
